# Stalwart TLSA Updater for Cloudflare

This is a containerized Python script that keeps the TLSA records for a domain up-to-date with the SSL certificate of the domain generated by the Stalwart email server.

Note: this is a temporary solution until Stalwart supports automatic TLSA record updates.
